#Moba Project
Probably abandoned project that was supposed to be a job for someone else, but I never got saw a cent from it, so I've decided to open-source it.

It's not a lot, but I think it's one of my best applications of OOP yet, especially the interactable object class.

Open the MainScene.unity file inside of Unity to get started

 When changing the position of anything steppable on on the map, open the Navigation tab and click Bake first! Otherwise, the old pathing data will stay there and the new movement will make no sense.
